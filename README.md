## NLP Learning Journey

### Overview
This repository is a dedicated space for mastering Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on computational linguistics, text analysis, and language modeling. Built as part of my Honours in AIML at the University of Mumbai, this repo is where I hone skills for real-world NLP challenges, exploring techniques like sentiment analysis, text classification, and transformer-based models.

### Features  
Text Analysis: Processes raw text data, tackling tokenization, stemming, and named entity recognition.  
Data Retrieval: Pulls text datasets from sources like IMDb, SQuAD, or web scraping for robust analysis.  
Learning Exercises: Solves NLP challenges from platforms like Kaggle and custom tasks.  
Project Builds: Develops tools like chatbots, sentiment analyzers, or text summarization pipelines.  
Modular Setup: Organizes tutorials, assignments, experiments, and projects for streamlined learning.

### Architecture
This is a lean NLP learning pipeline:  
Tutorials: Each tutorial is curated to a specific Framework and Libraries.
Assignments: Solutions to NLP problems, such as text classification or topic modeling..  
Experiments: Quick tests for ideas like fine-tuning BERT or larger models.  
Projects: Practical tools for real-world NLP applications, such as automated summarization or dialog systems.

### Tech Stack   
Python: The backbone for all coding tasks.
Hugging Face Transformers: Advanced models for tasks like text generation and classification.
Langchain: 
NLTK: Core library for foundational NLP tasks.  
spaCy: Efficient preprocessing and entity recognition.   
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.  
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization of text analytics and model performance.
Unsloth: High-performance library for efficient fine-tuning and deployment of large language models.
LangChain: Building context-aware NLP applications with LLMs and external data integration.

### Getting Started Prerequisites  
Python 3.10+  
pip (Python package manager)
