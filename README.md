## 🧬 Bioinformatics Learning Journey

### 📋 Overview 
Learning Journey is a repo for mastering computational biology. It’s all about sequence analysis, data retrieval, and biological modeling using Biopython. Built as part of my Honours in AIML at the University of Mumbai, this is where I hammer out skills for real-world bio challenges.

### ✨ Features
- Sequence AnalysisTackles FASTA files and sequence parsing like a pro.
- Data RetrievalGrabs genomic data from NCBI for deep analysis.
- Learning ExercisesSmashes Rosalind challenges and custom tasks.
- Project BuildsCrafts tools like sequence pipelines for automation.
- Modular SetupKeeps tutorials, assignments, and experiments tight and organized.

### 🏗️ ArchitectureThis is a lean learning pipeline:

- Tutorials: Step-by-step bio coding basics
- Assignments: Solutions to tough problems
- Experiments: Quick tests and ideas
- Projects: Solid tools for real use

### 🧰 Tech Stack

Biopython — Core library for bioinformatics tasks  
Python — The backbone of the grind  
Pandas — Data crunching power  
Matplotlib — Visuals that hit hard

### 🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- 4GB+ RAM (recommended)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NIKO-2182/bioinformatics-learning.git
cd bioinformatics-learning
python -m venv venv
